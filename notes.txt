# Plan

1) Get all movies from BOM from 1980 (to start with) till 2019
with earnings of > 1mil adjusted (we'll make 2019 partial)

This'll be the initial sample selection

-- Done

2) For each movie, look at cast makeup using IMDb.

3) Look for trends in overall representation,  between crew makeup and 
dir/prod/writer as a function of male/female.

# Notes

(probably borrowing some code from a previous BOM api that's now depricated)

Ooohk, BOM people index could be useful maybe, has gross per human... tho can
prolly put this together in a minute... we'll see.
