# Plan

1) Get all movies from BOM from 1980 (to start with) till 2019
with earnings of > 1mil adjusted (we'll make 2019 partial)

    This'll be the initial sample selection

-- Done

Should check for biases in terms of sample selection (gross cutoffs)

2) For each movie, look at cast makeup using IMDb.

    Will use title/year as unique identifier to find the IMDb entry.
        For some reason BOM doesn't have a direct link to IMDb page... 
        same company... why not...
    (Combo of title/year has no duplicates within dataset)


    IMDb has a lot of info fields, but for now just getting immediately
    relevant ones- 'main' for movie and 'biography' for person

3) Look for trends in overall representation,  between crew makeup and 
dir/prod/writer as a function of male/female.

# Notes

(probably borrowing some code from a previous BOM api that's now depricated)

Ooohk, BOM people index could be useful maybe, has gross per human... tho can
prolly put this together in a minute... we'll see.
